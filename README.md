A key feature is the integration of basket analysis, which leverages association rule mining to identify product purchasing patterns. This analysis helps generate personalized product recommendations, such as "customers who bought X also bought Y," enhancing the user experience and driving sales.

The website backend is developed with Flask, using a relational database for product and order management. Basket analysis is implemented using Python libraries like Pandas and ML models to analyze transaction data in real-time. The project demonstrates the use of data analytics to improve e-commerce operations and customer engagement.
